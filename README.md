# Atomic Spork (WIP!)

A light-mode fork of [Plastic](https://plastic.wstone.uk/) with colors incorporated from [Atom One Light Theme](https://github.com/akamud/vscode-theme-onelight).

## Notable features

- Light UI elements for focused coding.
- Syntax highlighting from Plastic with adjusted colors from Atom One Light theme.
- Additional deprioritised-punctuation theme; unedited from Plastic but planned to convert to light mode for Atomic Spork.

## License

## Development

TBA; working on understanding how Plastic's generator works! Text from original readme:

The themes are created using a generator: `src/index.js`. The configuration can
be found in the `src/theme-main.js` files.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Finish complete theming of all UI elements
- [ ] Tweak terminal tokens using Plastic colors for all "Bright" variants
- [ ] Tweak border contrast in most places
- [ ] Package for VSCode marketplace?
